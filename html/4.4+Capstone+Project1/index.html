        <p>
            "The IT Cyber Community of Pamulang University was established on
            June 19th, 2010. It started with a few students from Pamulang
            University, particularly from the Faculty of Informatics
            Engineering, who were concerned about the lack of facilities and
            learning opportunities on campus at that time.
            <br />
            We realized that the Faculty of Informatics Engineering was
            relatively new, and so we, the morning and evening students, took
            the initiative to create a learning group that formed a community
            based on a sense of family, commitment, and a shared goal."
